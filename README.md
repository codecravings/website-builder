# 🤖✨ AI Website Builder

**Because why hire a web developer when you can argue with an AI instead?**

---

## 🧐 What is this?

An AI-powered website builder that lets you create full websites just by talking to it.
It’s like having a tireless, judgment-free developer who won’t ghost you mid-project or ask for pizza.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎨 **AI-generated websites** – Probably better than your cousin who “does coding.”
* ✏️ **Post-generation editing** – For when the AI takes *too* many creative liberties.
* 🛠️ **Vue 3 + TypeScript** – Because we like to feel fancy and scalable.
* 🎯 **Tailwind CSS** – Look professional without writing 500 lines of CSS.
* 📱 **Fully responsive** – Works on your phone, tablet, or even that smart fridge you regret buying.
