# AI Website Builder 🤖✨

Because why hire a web developer when you can argue with an AI instead?

## What is this?

An AI-powered website builder that lets you create websites by talking to a robot. It's like having a very patient web developer who never asks for coffee breaks or complains about your design choices.

## Features

- 🎨 AI generates websites (probably better than your nephew who "knows computers")
- ✏️ Post-generation editing (for when the AI gets creative)
- 🚀 Vue 3 + TypeScript (because we're fancy like that)
- 🎯 Tailwind CSS (for when you want to look professional)
- 📱 Responsive design (works on your phone, your tablet, and your smart fridge)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it. No PhD in computer science required.

## Usage

1. Open the app
2. Tell the AI what you want
3. Watch the magic happen
4. Complain about the colors
5. Edit until satisfied
6. Repeat steps 4-5 indefinitely
